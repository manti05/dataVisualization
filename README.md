## Introduction

This data visualization application allows you to explore and visualize life expectancy data for various countries. It provides several types of visualizations to help you better understand and compare life expectancies, birth rates, and death rates in different regions.

## Features

- **Life Expectancy Graph**: Visualize the top 5 and bottom 5 male and female life expectancies in a bar chart.

- **Male and Female Life Expectancy Line Graphs**: Compare the male and female life expectancies for the top N countries in a line graph.

- **Grouped Bar Charts**: Create grouped bar charts to compare life expectancies, birth rates, and death rates for the top N countries, sorted by either male life expectancy, female life expectancy, birth rate, or death rate.
